3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```env
    # Prisma / MongoDB
    DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/<database_name>"

    # NextAuth.js
